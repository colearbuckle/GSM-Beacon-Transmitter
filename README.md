# GSM-Beacon-Transmitter
Files for Universal Radio Hacker of real GSM beacons produced and generated by me using my OpenBTS setup. With this file, anyone can use URA and a compatible and transmission capable SDR to broadcast their own real GSM beacon. These beacons are even detected during a network scan on a mobile phone (tested with Android, iPhone, and 2000s phones).
